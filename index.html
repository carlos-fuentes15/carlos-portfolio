    <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio</h2>
    <p>I'm Carlos Sebastian Fuentes, a driven Information Technology major with a deep interest in the intersection of design and development. My academic background combines technical knowledge with creativity, allowing me to develop intuitive, user-focused solutions that address real-world challenges.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Through coursework and personal projects like ParkHero, I’ve gathered skills in front-end web development, UI/UX design, and user research. I strive to understand user needs and build systems that are not only functional but also engaging and accessible.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Currently, I work part-time at Marshalls, where I've developed strong communication, teamwork, and time-management skills. My goal is to transition into a professional role where I can contribute meaningfully to a tech-driven team, grow as a developer and designer, and continue exploring ways to enhance the user experience.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Here are a few little facts about me. I share a two brothers and one sister. My mother took care of the three of us exluding one of my other brothers because my father passed away. She is one of the main factors on why I work so hard, she inspires me daily.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I have a pet cat named Yumi, she is adorable. One thing though is that she only shows affection when she is hungry.</p>
    <br>
    <p> I love listening to music, watching movies, and reading mystery books in my free time. These are one of the few hobbies I like to escape with when I have the time.</p>
