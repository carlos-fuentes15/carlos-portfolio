    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm Carlos Sebastian Fuentes, a driven Information Technology major with a deep interest in the intersection of design and development. My academic background combines technical knowledge with creativity, allowing me to develop intuitive, user-focused solutions that address real-world challenges.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Through coursework and personal projects like ParkHero, I’ve gathered skills in front-end web development, UI/UX design, and user research. I strive to understand user needs and build systems that are not only functional but also engaging and accessible.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Currently, I work part-time at Marshalls, where I've developed strong communication, teamwork, and time-management skills. My goal is to transition into a professional role where I can contribute meaningfully to a tech-driven team, grow as a developer and designer, and continue exploring ways to enhance the user experience.</p>
